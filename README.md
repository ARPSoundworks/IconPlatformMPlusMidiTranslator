# IconPlatformMPlusMidiTranslator
Allows using the Icon Platform M+ as both a control surface and MIDI CC faders without losing functions. Filters fader data (pitchbend) and routes it based on mode. In Logic mode, faders go from 0â€“117 (not 127); values are rescaled for CC but shown raw in the UI. Runs in background with a tray icon.
